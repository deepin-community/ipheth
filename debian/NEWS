ipheth (1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  As of 21 April 2010, the ipheth kernel module has been accepted in
  the mainstream Linux kernel (2.6.34). The Debian kernel team have 
  backported the driver which has been available since Debian kernel
  2.6.32-12. There is therefore no longer any need to supply the source
  code for the driver. For this reason, the ipheth-dkms package been
  removed.

  If you run a desktop system, it may not be necessary to install
  ipheth-utils. Desktop packages such as GVFS and libgpod automatically
  pair with the device when it is plugged in. The ipheth-utils package
  will therefore be of specific interest to users wanting only to make
  use of the iPhone's Internet connection.

  Users upgrading from version 1.0-1 are advised to remove the
  ipheth-dkms package in order to use the kernel maintained driver.
